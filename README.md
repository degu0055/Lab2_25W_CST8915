# Lab 2 - CST8915 Full-stack Cloud-native Development
In this lab, you will:
1. Refactor the [**Algonquin Pet Store**](https://github.com/ramymohamed10/Algonquin_Pet_Store_25W_CST8915) application to comply with the first four factors of the [**12-Factor App**](https://12factor.net/): **Codebase**, **Dependencies**, **Configuration**, and **Backing Services**.
2. Set up **RabbitMQ** on an Azure VM, and configure the connection between RabbitMQ and `order-service`

Throughout this lab, you will use VS Code for editing code, managing repositories, and deploying the apps.

## Prerequisites
- Azure Account: Access to Microsoft Azure with permissions to create resources.
- Visual Studio Code: Download and install from https://code.visualstudio.com/.
- Git: Installed on your local machine.
## Refactoring for 12-Factor Compliance
### Factor 1: Codebase
A single codebase should be used, with version control, for each microservice.

1. **Create a separate GitHub repository** under your GitHub account for each service.
   - For example, create three repositories:
      - `order-service`
      - `product-service`
      - `store-front`
2. **Copy the content** for each service from the existing codebase on [Algonquin Pet Store](https://github.com/ramymohamed10/Algonquin_Pet_Store_25W_CST8915).
   - The `order-service` code is found in the `order-service` directory.
   - The `product-service` code is found in the `product-service` directory.
   - The `store-front` code is found in the `store-front` directory.
3. **Push each service** to its respective repository. This way, each service will have its own codebase, tracked separately.
### Factor 2: Dependencies
Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies.
1. **Ensure all dependencies are declared in a dependency management file.** 
   - For the **order-service (Node.js)**, ensure all required modules are listed in the `package.json` file.
   - Dependencies for the **product-service (Rust)** should be explicitly declared in the `Cargo.toml` file.
    - Generally, you need to include a manifest file that declares the dependencies of your app. 
      - For example, if you rewrite `product-service` in Python, you must ensure a `requirements.txt` file is present.
   
   The **Algonquin Pet Store App** services are **already compliant**. All dependencies for each service are properly declared.
2. **Use dependency isolation.** 
   - **Node.js (Order-Service)**: Use `npm install` to install dependencies in the `node_modules` directory and avoid using global dependencies. This ensures that all modules are isolated to the application and not globally installed on the machine.
      - The `node_modules` folder will be created locally within the project directory, ensuring dependencies are specific to the app.
   - **Rust (Product-Service)**: In Rust, dependencies are isolated by using the **Cargo** package manager. When you run `cargo build` or `cargo install`, it installs dependencies locally within the `target` directory. 
      - The `target` folder will be created locally within the project directory, ensuring dependencies are specific to the app.
   - **Python**:
     - In Python, to ensure dependency isolation, create and activate a **virtual environment** for the project. This prevents global installation of libraries and ensures all dependencies are specific to the project.
     - Create a virtual environment using `venv`:
       ```bash
       python -m venv venv
       ```
     - Activate the virtual environment:
       - On macOS/Linux:
         ```bash
         source venv/bin/activate
         ```
       - On Windows:
         ```bash
         venv\Scripts\activate
         ```
     - Install dependencies using `pip` and ensure they are listed in `requirements.txt`:
       ```bash
       pip install -r requirements.txt
       ```
      - A `.venv` folder will be created locally within the project directory, ensuring dependencies are specific to the app.
      - This isolates Python dependencies to the virtual environment, preventing any conflicts with system-level libraries.
### Factor 3: Configurations
Store configuration in the environment.

Extract any hard-coded configuration from the code (such as database URLs, RabbitMQ connection strings, ports, etc.) into environment variables.

1. **order-service**
   - Configure the **order-service** to use environment variables instead of hard-coded values.
   - You have been provided with an updated [index.js](order-service-algonquin-pet-store/index.js) file for the **order-service**, located within folder: `order-service-algonquin-pet-store`. 
   - Navigate to your **order-service repository** and locate the `index.js` file. Open the file and **replace its content** with the content in the updated [index.js](order-service-algonquin-pet-store/index.js) file.
      - This updated file ensures that configuration values like the **RabbitMQ connection string** and **port number** are retrieved from environment variables instead of being hard-coded.
      - The updated `index.js` file now uses the `dotenv` library to load environment variables from a `.env` file **during development only**.
   - You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your order-service. This file will store all environment-specific configurations, such as the RabbitMQ connection string and the port number. The `.env` file should not be included in version control (Git), so make sure you add it to `.gitignore`.
   - Here’s what the content of your `.env` file should look like:
      ```bash
      # RabbitMQ connection string
      RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_STRING=amqp://your_username:your_password@<VM_IP>:5672/

      # Port for the order-service to listen on
      PORT=3000
       ```

      - RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_STRING: Replace your_username, your_password, and <VM_IP> with the appropriate values for your RabbitMQ server. This connection string tells the order-service where RabbitMQ is running.
      - PORT: The port number on which your order-service will run. If you do not define this, the service will default to port 3000.
   - You will need to install the dotenv package to load environment variables from the .env file into your application. Run the following command in your order-service directory:
      ```bash
      npm install dotenv
      ```
   - Once the `.env` file is set up and the dotenv package is installed, restart your order-service and test it to ensure it is correctly using the environment variables.

2. **product-service**
   - Configure the **product-service** to use environment variables instead of hard-coded values.
   - You have been provided with an updated [main.rs](product-service-algonquin-pet-store/main.rs) file for the **product-service**, located within the folder: `product-service-algonquin-pet-store`. 
   - Navigate to your **product-service repository** and locate the `main.rs` file. Open the file and **replace its content** with the content in the updated [main.rs](product-service-algonquin-pet-store/main.rs) file.
      - This updated file ensures that configuration values like the **port number** are retrieved from environment variables instead of being hard-coded.
      - The updated `main.rs` file now uses the `dotenv` crate to load environment variables from a `.env` file **during development only**.
   - You need to create a `.env` file in the root directory of your product-service. This file will store environment-specific configurations such as the port number. The `.env` file should not be included in version control (Git), so make sure you add it to `.gitignore`.
   - Here’s what the content of your `.env` file should look like:
      ```bash
      # Port for the product-service to listen on
      PORT=3030
      ```

      - `PORT`: The port number on which your **product-service** will run. If you do not define this, the service will default to port 3030.
   - You will need to add the `dotenv` crate to your **Cargo.toml** file to load environment variables from the `.env` file into your application. Add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` dependencies:
      ```toml
      [dependencies]
      dotenv = "0.15"
      ```
   - Once the `.env` file is set up and the `dotenv` crate is added, run `cargo build` to install the dependencies and restart your **product-service**. Test it to ensure it is correctly using the environment variables.

3. **store-front**
   - Configure the **store-front** to use environment variables instead of hard-coded values.
   - You have been provided with an updated [**`src`**](store-front-algonquin-pet-store/src) folder that you should use to replace the **`src`** folder of your **store-front** Vue.js application in your repository. This updated folder will include code that utilizes environment variables instead of hard-coded values.

   - In a Vue.js application, you can use `.env` files to store environment-specific configurations. Vue.js requires environment variable names to start with `VUE_APP_`.
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory of your **store-front** application. This file will store all environment-specific configurations, such as API URLs for the order-service and product-service. The `.env` file should not be included in version control (Git), so make sure you add it to `.gitignore`.
   - Here’s what the content of your `.env` file should look like:
      ```bash
      # API URL for the order-service
      VUE_APP_ORDER_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3000

      # API URL for the product-service
      VUE_APP_PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3030
      ```

      - `VUE_APP_ORDER_SERVICE_URL`: Replace this with the correct URL for your **order-service** (e.g., your deployed service URL in development).
      - `VUE_APP_PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL`: Replace this with the correct URL for your **product-service** (e.g., your deployed service URL in development).
      - In your Vue.js application code, use `process.env` to access these environment variables. For example:
         ```javascript
         const orderServiceUrl = process.env.VUE_APP_ORDER_SERVICE_URL;
         const productServiceUrl = process.env.VUE_APP_PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL;
         ```
      - Once the `.env` file is set up, run your development server to ensure it is correctly using the environment variables:
         ```bash
         npm run serve
         ```
      - To use environment variables in production, you can create a `.env.production` file with production-specific values, like this:
         ```bash
         # Production API URL for the order-service
         VUE_APP_ORDER_SERVICE_URL=https://api.production.com/order-service

         # Production API URL for the product-service
         VUE_APP_PRODUCT_SERVICE_URL=https://api.production.com/product-service
         ```
      - To build the application for production, run:
         ```bash
         npm run build
         ```
      - Test your Vue.js application to ensure it is correctly using the environment variables in both development and production environments.
### Factor 4: Backing Services
Treat backing services (like databases, message brokers) as attached resources.

- In this section, you will configure RabbitMQ as a backing service for your application by using a RabbitMQ instance hosted on an Azure VM. Instead of relying on RabbitMQ running on `localhost`, you will deploy RabbitMQ on an **Ubuntu 20.04 VM** from the Azure Marketplace and configure your application to connect to this external RabbitMQ instance.

- You will use a pre-configured **RabbitMQ on Ubuntu 20.04 VM** from **Apps4Rent LLC** in the Azure Marketplace to set up RabbitMQ, then create a new username and password to establish a secure connection.

#### Steps to Set Up RabbitMQ on Azure VM

1. **Deploy RabbitMQ on Ubuntu 20.04 from Azure Marketplace**:
   - Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - In the search bar, search for "**RabbitMQ on Ubuntu 20.04**" by **Apps4Rent LLC**.
   - Select this image and click **Create**.
   - Fill in the required details for your VM (e.g., resource group, VM name, region, size: B1s, etc.).
   - For **authentication type**, choose **SSH public key**. Ensure you remember the authentication details as you will use them to access the VM.
   - Once you have configured the VM settings, click **Review + Create** and then **Create** to deploy the VM.
   - Ensure that **ports 5672** (used by RabbitMQ) and **15672** (used by the RabbitMQ Management UI) are open and accessible on the VM. You can do this by configuring the **network security group (NSG)** associated with your VM in the Azure portal.

2. **Access the RabbitMQ VM**:
   - After the VM is deployed, go to your **Azure Portal** and navigate to your **Virtual Machines**.
   - Locate your RabbitMQ VM and click on it to view its details.
   - Find the **public IP address** of the VM, which you will use to connect to the VM via SSH.
   - Connect to the VM using VS Code.

3. **Create a New RabbitMQ User**:
   - Once you are connected to the VM, you need to create a new RabbitMQ user for secure access.
   - Create a new RabbitMQ user by running the following command:
     ```bash
     sudo rabbitmqctl add_user your_username your_password
     ```
     Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the desired username and password for the RabbitMQ connection.
   - Assign administrative privileges to the user:
     ```bash
     sudo rabbitmqctl set_user_tags your_username administrator
     ```
   - Set permissions for the user to manage RabbitMQ:
     ```bash
     sudo rabbitmqctl set_permissions -p / your_username ".*" ".*" ".*"
     ```

4. **Retrieve the RabbitMQ Connection String**:
   - After creating the user, you can form your RabbitMQ connection string.
   - The connection string format is:
     ```bash
     amqp://your_username:your_password@<VM_IP>:5672/
     ```
     Replace `your_username` and `your_password` with the credentials you created, and `<VM_IP>` with the public IP address of your Azure VM.

5. **Configure Your Application to Use RabbitMQ**:
   - In your **order-service** `.env` file, update the `RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_STRING` environment variable with the new RabbitMQ connection string:
     ```bash
     RABBITMQ_CONNECTION_STRING=amqp://your_username:your_password@<VM_IP>:5672/
     ```
   - This will ensure that your services communicate with the RabbitMQ instance running on the Azure VM.

6. **Test the RabbitMQ Setup**:
   - Restart your **order-service** to apply the changes.
   - Test your application by sending requests to the **order-service** to verify that they can communicate with RabbitMQ on the Azure VM.
   - You can monitor the status of RabbitMQ by logging into the RabbitMQ management UI.
